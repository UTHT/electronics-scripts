# AcuAMP DCT500-42-24-F

## Sensor Information

### Sensor Output
- Current [Amp], range: 0[A] to 500[A]

### Sensor Use
- This sensor monitors the current output from the high voltage battery system (direct current) to the inverter/motor for safety, alerting the team in case of any irregularity. 

### Code Description
1. Current is calculated by proportionally mapping the output of the sensor(4-20mA) over the Current range(0-500A).
2. The calculated current is returned
