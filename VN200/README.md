# VectorNav VN200

## Sensor Information

### Sensor Output
- Position (GPS)
- Rotation [째/s, (Euler angles)], range: -2000[째/s] to +2000[째/s]
- Velocity [m/s], range: 0[m/s] to 500[m/s]
- Acceleration [g], range: -16[g] to +16[g]
- Angular velocity [째/s, (Euler angles)]
- Magnetic field [Gauss], range: -2.5[Gauss] to +2.5[Gauss]
- Pressure [mbar], range: 10[mbar] to 1200[mbar]

### Sensor Use
- This sensor has an industrial-grade 9-axis GNSS and inertial navigation system; three-axes of each: accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer, along with a pressure sensor and 32-bit processor. This will be used for navigation of the pod and will have an associated control system.

### Code Description
1. We are using Serial TTL (RX)  from Arduino Due UART (TX) to communicate with the sensor, alone with existing online libraries and softwares.
